# Master - Stream Processing
## Simulation Part

This project simulates a building. <br>
The Simulation is heavily simplified and used to generate Data, we use this Data to get in touch with stream processing. See the [python program](https://github.com/ixLikro/master-stream-processing-python) for more information.

The generated data will be send via a socket connection. <br>
Every simulated Sensor has it own Socket connection.

We simulate a detached house with an off-grind photovoltaic system. <br>
The energy simulation is based on the [Photovoltaic Geographical Information System](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/tools.html) with the location Wolfenb√ºttel, Germany.

## Dynamic Settings
You can change some settings like simulation speed, window states or the current simulation time even if the simulation is currently running! <br> See [settings.conf]() for more information
